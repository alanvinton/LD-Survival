It's a basic survival game, the aim is to stay alive as long as you can (it has no real "end-goal" - maybe a high score system/days survived?)

You need to eat, drink and watch your body temperature to survive. Allowing yourself to starve or be too thirsty, or too cold will eventually kill you.

Winter is punishing so be sure to keep an eye on your temperature.

Food will spawn randomly, these are green blocks
White blocks are animals - when the blocks contain green, the animal is hungry
Step into water (blue) to refill your water bottle (max 5 uses)

A lot of things will make you hungry and thirsty so be sure to keep an eye on those bars!
